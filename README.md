Repository for code for the WWU Winter Hackathon

## To run the visualization
You will need to install [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org/)

Then to run the visualization you will need to run the `love` executable and pass in the visualization folder. Along with the file you want to load.

### Example
`love wwu-hax/visualization log1.txt`

This assumes you have love added to your PATH, if not you need to provide the full path to love2d like so

`C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe .\visualization .\log1.txt`
